The file teams.csv contains data for each teams attack strength (column 1) and defence strength (column 2). These are calculated using statistics from the qualifying games. The attack strength and defence strength is also adjusted for the average elo-rating (https://www.eloratings.net/) of each qualifying tournament. I.e. Tunisia scoring many goals against burundi won't count as much as Peru scoring many goals against Brazil.

Note that this is quick and dirty and just for fun.
